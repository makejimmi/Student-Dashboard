# Student-Dashboard
A university project showcasing our skills in full-stack web development. Built from scratch using HTML, CSS and JS this dashboard integrates with a local server (using XAMPP) to save and retrieve data in JSON format. The project demonstrates our ability to create responsive, dynamic web applications with a focus on user experience.
